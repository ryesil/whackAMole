    // Question 1
//        Barking Dog
//        We have a dog that likes to bark.  We need to wake up if the dog is barking at night!
//
//                Write a method shouldWakeUp that has 2 parameters.
//
//        1st parameter should be of type boolean and be named barking it represents if our dog is currently barking.
//        2nd parameter represents the hour of the day and is of type int with the name hourOfDay and has a valid range of 0-23.
//
//        We have to wake up if the dog is barking before 8 or after 22 hours so in that case return true.
//
//                In all other cases return false.
//
//                If the hourOfDay parameter is less than 0 or greater than 23 return false.
//
//                Examples of input/output:
//
//        shouldWakeUp (true, 1); → should return true
//
//        shouldWakeUp (false, 2); → should return false since the dog is not barking.
//
//        shouldWakeUp (true, 8); → should return false, since it's not before 8.
//
//        shouldWakeUp (true, -1); → should return false since the hourOfDay parameter needs to be in a range 0-23.


        /* Q2 - Area Calculator
    Write a method named area with one double parameter named radius.
    The method needs to return a double value that represents the area of a circle.
    If the parameter radius is negative then return -1.0 to represent an invalid value.
    Write another overloaded method with 2 parameters x and y (both doubles), where x and y represent the sides of a rectangle.
    The method needs to return an area of a rectangle.
    If either or both parameters is/are a negative return -1.0 to indicate an invalid value.
    For formulas and PI value please check the tips below.
    Examples of input/output:
    area(5.0); should return 78.53981633974483 or 78.53981
    area(-1);  should return -1 since the parameter is negative
    area(5.0, 4.0); should return 20.0 (5 * 4 = 20)
    area(-1.0, 4.0);  should return -1 since first the parameter is negative

    //    Question 3
//    Equality Printer
//    Write a method printEqual with 3 parameters of type int. The method should not return anything (void).
//    If one of the parameters is less than 0, print text "Invalid Value".
//    If all numbers are equal print text "All numbers are equal"
//    If all numbers are different print text "All numbers are different".
//    Otherwise, print "Neither all are equal or different".
//
//    EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:
//    printEqual(1, 1, 1); should print text All numbers are equal
//    printEqual(1, 1, 2); should print text Neither all are equal nor different
//    printEqual(-1, -1, -1); should print text Invalid Value
//    printEqual(1, 2, 3); should print text All numbers are different

    /* Question-4
    Write a method that takes two integers as input and performs the following operations based on their values:
    1- If both numbers are positive, print the sum of the two numbers.
    2- If both numbers are negative, print the multiplication of the two numbers.
    3- If the numbers have different signs (one is positive and the other is negative),
       print: "Cannot perform operations with numbers of different signs."
    4- If either number is zero, print: "Zero is the absorbing element for multiplication."
     */


//Question 5
//Number Palindrome
//    Write a method called isPalindrome with one int parameter called number.
//    The method needs to return a boolean.
//    It should return true if the number is a palindrome number otherwise it should return false.
//    Check the tips below for more info about palindromes.
//    Example Input/Output
//    isPalindrome(-1221); → should return true
//    isPalindrome(707); → should return true
//    isPalindrome(11212); → should return false because reverse is 21211 and that is not equal to 11212.
//    Tip: What is a Palindrome number?  A palindrome number is a number which when reversed is equal to the original number.
//    For example: 121, 12321, 1001 etc.

    /*Question 6
    Write a method in Java that generates the following pattern based on the number of rows provided as a parameter.
    The numbers should start from 1 and increment sequentially.
    For example, for 4 rows:
    1
    2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9 10
    */

    //Question 7
//    First And Last Digit Sum
//    Write a method named sumFirstAndLastDigit with one parameter of type int called number.
//    The method needs to find the first and the last digit of the parameter number passed to the method, using a loop and return the sum of the first and the last digit of that number.
//    If the number is negative then the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
//    Example input/output
//    sumFirstAndLastDigit(252); → should return 4, the first digit is 2 and the last is 2 which gives us 2+2 and the sum is 4.
//    sumFirstAndLastDigit(257); → should return 9, the first digit is 2 and the last is 7 which gives us 2+7 and the sum is 9.
//    sumFirstAndLastDigit(0); → should return 0, the first digit and the last digit is 0 since we only have 1 digit, which gives us 0+0 and the sum is 0.
//    sumFirstAndLastDigit(5); → should return 10, the first digit and the last digit is 5 since we only have 1 digit, which gives us 5+5 and the sum is 10.
//    sumFirstAndLastDigit(-10); → should return -1, since the parameter is negative and needs to be positive.

    //Question 8
//    Even Digit Sum
//    Write a method named getEvenDigitSum with one parameter of type int called number.
//    The method should return the sum of the even digits within the number.
//    If the number is negative, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
//    EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
//    getEvenDigitSum(123456789); → should return 20 since 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
//    getEvenDigitSum(252); → should return 4 since 2 + 2 = 4
//    getEvenDigitSum(-22); → should return -1 since the number is negative


    //Question 9
//    Shared Digit
//    Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int.
//    Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is not within the range, the method should return false.
//    The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23; otherwise, the method should return false.
//    EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
//    hasSharedDigit(12, 23); → should return true since the digit 2 appears in both numbers
//    hasSharedDigit(9, 99); → should return false since 9 is not within the range of 10-99
//    hasSharedDigit(15, 55); → should return true since the digit 5 appears in both numbers

   //Question 10
//   Last Digit Checker
//    Write a method named hasSameLastDigit with three parameters of type int.
//    Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 1000 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is not within the range, the method should return false.
//    The method should return true if at least two of the numbers share the same rightmost digit; otherwise, it should return false.
//    EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
//    hasSameLastDigit (41, 22, 71); → should return true since 1 is the rightmost digit in numbers 41 and 71
//    hasSameLastDigit (23, 32, 42); → should return true since 2 is the rightmost digit in numbers 32 and 42
//    hasSameLastDigit (9, 99, 999); → should return false since 9 is not within the range of 10-1000

//    Write another method named isValid with one parameter of type int.
//    The method needs to return true if the number parameter is in range of 10(inclusive) - 1000(inclusive), otherwise return false.
//    EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT
//    isValid(10); → should return true since 10 is within the range of 10-1000
//    isValid(468); → should return true since 468 is within the range of 10-1000
//    isValid(1051); → should return false since 1051 is not within the range of 10-1000

  //Q11
//  All Factors
//    Write a method named printFactors with one parameter of type int named number.
//    If number is < 1, the method should print "Invalid Value".
//    The method should print all factors of the number. A factor of a number is an integer which divides that number wholly (i.e. without leaving a remainder).
//    For example, 3 is a factor of 6 because 3 fully divides 6 without leaving a remainder. In other words 6 / 3 = 2.

//    EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
//    printFactors(6); → should print 1 2 3 6
//    printFactors(32); → should print 1 2 4 8 16 32
//    printFactors(10); → should print 1 2 5 10
//    printFactors(-1); → should print "Invalid Value" since number is < 1

   //Q12
//   Diagonal Star
//    Write a method named printSquareStar with one parameter of type int named number.
//    If number is < 5, the method should print "Invalid Value".
//    The method should print diagonals to generate a rectangular pattern composed of stars (*). This should be accomplished by using loops (see examples below).

//    EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
//    EXAMPLE 1
//    printSquareStar(5); should print the following:
//            → NOTE: For text in Code Blocks below, use code icon {...}  on Udemy
//        *****
//        ** **
//        * * *
//        ** **
//        *****

//    Explanation:
//
//*****   5 stars
//** **   2 stars space 2 stars
//* * *   1 star space 1 star space 1 star
//** **   2 stars space 2 stars
//*****   5 stars
//
//
//    EXAMPLE 2
//    printSquareStar(8); should print the following:
//            ********
//            **    **
//            * *  * *
//            *  **  *
//            *  **  *
//            * *  * *
//            **    **
//            ********
//    The patterns above consist of a number of rows and columns (where number is the number of rows to print). For each row or column, stars are printed based on four conditions (Read them carefully):
//    In the first or last row
//    In the first or last column
//    When the row number equals the column number
//    When the column number equals rowCount - currentRow + 1 (where currentRow is current row number)

    //Q13
//    Flour Pack Problem
//    Write a method named canPack with three parameters of type int named bigCount, smallCount, and goal.
//    The parameter bigCount represents the count of big flour bags (5 kilos each).
//    The parameter smallCount represents the count of small flour bags (1 kilo each).
//    The parameter goal represents the goal amount of kilos of flour needed to assemble a package.
//    Therefore, the sum of the kilos of bigCount and smallCount must be at least equal to the value of goal. The method should return true if it is possible to make a package with goal kilos of flour.
//    If the sum is greater than goal, ensure that only full bags are used towards the goal amount. For example, if goal = 9, bigCount = 2, and smallCount = 0, the method should return false since each big bag is 5 kilos and cannot be divided.
//    However, if goal = 9, bigCount = 1, and smallCount = 5, the method should return true because of 1 full bigCount bag and 4 full smallCount bags equal goal, and it's okay if there are additional bags left over.
//    If any of the parameters are negative, return false.

//    EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
//    canPack (1, 0, 4); should return false since bigCount is 1 (big bag of 5 kilos) and goal is 4 kilos.
//            canPack (1, 0, 5); should return true since bigCount is 1 (big bag of 5 kilos) and goal is 5 kilos.
//            canPack (0, 5, 4); should return true since smallCount is 5 (small bags of 1 kilo) and goal is 4 kilos, and we have 1 bag left which is ok as mentioned above.
//    canPack (2, 2, 11); should return true since bigCount is 2 (big bags 5 kilos each) and smallCount is 2 (small bags of 1 kilo), makes in total 12 kilos and goal is 11 kilos.
//            canPack (-3, 2, 12); should return false since bigCount is negative.

    //Q14
//    Number To Words
//    Write a method called numberToWords with one int parameter named number.
//    The method should print out the passed number using words for the digits.
//    If the number is negative, print "Invalid Value".
//    EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
//    numberToWords(123); should print "One Two Three".
//    numberToWords(1010); should print "One Zero One Zero".
//    numberToWords(1000); should print "One Zero Zero Zero".
//    numberToWords(-12); should print "Invalid Value" since the parameter is negative.

    //Q15
//    Shared Digit
//    Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int.
//    Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is not within the range, the method should return false.
//    The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23; otherwise, the method should return false.
//    EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
//    hasSharedDigit(12, 23); → should return true since the digit 2 appears in both numbers
//    hasSharedDigit(9, 99); → should return false since 9 is not within the range of 10-99
//    hasSharedDigit(15, 55); → should return true since the digit 5 appears in both numbers
